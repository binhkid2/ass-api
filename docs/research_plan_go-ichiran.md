# Research Plan: go-ichiran library

## I. Objectives
- Understand the capabilities and main features of the `go-ichiran` library.
- Document the API usage patterns and provide code examples.
- Identify installation requirements and dependencies.
- Analyze its Japanese dictionary and kanji analysis functionalities.
- Assess limitations and other considerations for using the library to build a web API.

## II. Research Breakdown
1.  **Initial Scoping and Information Gathering:**
    *   Search for the `go-ichiran` library to find its official repository (likely on GitHub), documentation, and any related articles or tutorials.
    *   Establish a baseline understanding of what the library is and its intended purpose.
2.  **In-depth Feature Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the library's source code and documentation to identify its core features.
    *   Focus on functionalities related to Japanese dictionary lookups, kanji analysis, and text processing.
3.  **API Usage and Integration:**
    *   Examine the public API of the library.
    *   Identify key functions and data structures.
    *   Develop example code snippets for common use cases, particularly for building a web API.
4.  **Installation and Dependencies:**
    *   Determine the steps required to install the library and any external dependencies.
    *   Document the process for setting up a development environment.
5.  **Dictionary and Kanji Analysis:**
    *   Investigate the dictionaries and data sources used by the library.
    *   Assess the depth and accuracy of the dictionary and kanji information provided.
6.  **Limitations and Considerations:**
    *   Identify any potential limitations, performance bottlenecks, or other factors to consider when using the library in a production environment.

## III. Key Questions
1.  What are the main functions exposed by the `go-ichiran` library for Japanese text analysis?
2.  How can the library be used to parse a Japanese sentence and get detailed information about each word (e.g., reading, definition, part of speech)?
3.  What are the data dependencies of the library (e.g., dictionary files)? How are they managed?
4.  What are the system requirements for running `go-ichiran`?
5.  Are there any existing examples of web APIs built with `go-ichiran`?
6.  What is the performance of the library like for real-time applications?

## IV. Resource Strategy
-   **Primary data sources:** GitHub repository for `go-ichiran`, official documentation.
-   **Search strategies:** "go-ichiran library", "go-ichiran documentation", "go-ichiran API example", "go-ichiran tutorial", "building web API with go-ichiran".

## V. Verification Plan
-   **Source requirements:** Prioritize the official `go-ichiran` repository and any linked documentation as the most reliable sources.
-   **Cross-validation:** Cross-reference information from different sources (e.g., README, source code, issues) to ensure consistency. Code examples will be validated by checking them against the library's actual API.

## VI. Expected Deliverables
-   A comprehensive markdown report analyzing the `go-ichiran` library.
-   The report will include sections on:
    -   Library capabilities and main features.
    -   API usage patterns and examples.
    -   Installation requirements and dependencies.
    -   Japanese dictionary and kanji analysis functionalities.
    -   Code examples for integration.
    -   Any limitations or considerations.

## Workflow Selection
-   **Primary focus:** Search-Focused Workflow. The primary goal is to gather information about the library.
-   **Justification:** The task is primarily about information retrieval and analysis of an existing library. I need to collect and synthesize information from various sources to produce the final report.
